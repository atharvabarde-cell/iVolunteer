# Quick Summary: Event Image Upload & Time Fix

## What Was Fixed

### 1. ✅ Time Display (AM/PM)
**Location**: Event Details Page

**Before**: `2:30` (unclear if morning or afternoon)
**After**: `2:30 PM` (clear 12-hour format)

**Change**: Updated `toLocaleTimeString()` to include `hour12: true` and proper locale.

### 2. ✅ Event Image Upload
**Location**: Create Event Form

**New Features**:
- 📤 **Upload Area**: Drag & drop interface with visual feedback
- 🖼️ **Image Preview**: See image before uploading
- ☁️ **Cloudinary Integration**: Images stored in cloud
- ✏️ **Image Caption**: Optional caption field
- ✅ **Upload Status**: Visual confirmation when uploaded
- 🗑️ **Remove Option**: Delete selected image

---

## How It Works

### Creating Event with Image:
1. Click upload area → Select image file
2. Preview appears → (Optional) Click "Upload Image" button
3. Fill out event details → Add optional caption
4. Submit form → Image auto-uploads if not done already
5. Event created with image!

### Viewing Event:
- Event detail page shows uploaded image at the top
- Falls back to gradient background if no image

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend:
- **File**: `frontend/app/add-event/page.tsx`
- **New Icons**: Upload, X, ImageIcon
- **New States**: eventImage, eventImagePreview, isUploadingImage, uploadedImageData
- **Upload Function**: `uploadEventImage()` - Uploads to backend API
- **UI**: Modern upload interface with preview and status

### Backend:
- **Model**: `backend/src/models/Event.js` - Added `image` field with url, caption, publicId
- **Controller**: `backend/src/controllers/ngoEvent.controller.js` - Added `uploadEventImage` function
- **Route**: `POST /v1/event/upload-event-image` - Handles image upload with multer
- **Storage**: Cloudinary folder `iVolunteer_events` with 1200x630px optimization
