## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **Account Deletion**
   - No recovery option (by design)
   - Cannot undo once deleted
   - All data permanently lost

2. **Password Change**
   - Doesn't force logout on other devices (sessions remain)
   - Consider adding session invalidation on password change

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for later:
- [ ] Email notification on password change
- [ ] Email notification on account deletion
- [ ] Grace period for account deletion (soft delete)
- [ ] Export user data before deletion
- [ ] Two-factor authentication support
- [ ] Password strength meter
- [ ] Password history (prevent reuse)
- [ ] Session invalidation on password change
