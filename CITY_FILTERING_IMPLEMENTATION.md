# City-Based Post Filtering - Implementation Summary

## ✅ Changes Made

### Backend Changes

#### 1. Post Model (`backend/src/models/Post.js`)
- ✅ Added `city` field (String, required, trimmed)
- ✅ Added index for city-based filtering: `postSchema.index({ city: 1, createdAt: -1 })`

#### 2. Post Controller (`backend/src/controllers/post.controller.js`)

**createPost Function:**
- ✅ Automatically extracts city from logged-in user's profile
- ✅ Handles different user roles (user, ngo, corporate)
- ✅ Validates that user has a city before creating post
- ✅ No longer requires city input from form - it's auto-filled

**getPosts Function:**
- ✅ Requires authentication (moved to protected route)
- ✅ Gets logged-in user's city
- ✅ Filters posts to show ONLY posts from user's city
- ✅ Uses case-insensitive regex matching
- ✅ Includes debug logging
- ✅ Validates user has city information

#### 3. Post Routes (`backend/src/routes/post.routes.js`)
- ✅ Added `authMiddleware` to `GET /` route
- ✅ Users must be authenticated to view posts

### Frontend Changes

#### Create Post Component (`frontend/components/create-post.tsx`)
- ✅ Removed city input field from form
- ✅ Removed city state variable
- ✅ Removed city validation
- ✅ City is now automatically taken from user's profile on backend

## 🎯 How It Works

### Post Creation Flow:
1. User creates a post (title, category, description, image)
2. Backend automatically adds user's city to the post
3. Post is saved with the city from user's profile

### Post Viewing Flow:
1. User logs in and requests posts
2. Backend checks user's city
3. Only posts matching user's city are returned
4. Filtering is case-insensitive (Mumbai = mumbai = MUMBAI)

## 📊 Current Database State

From diagnostics:
- **Posts:** 1 post with city "Mumbai"
- **Users:**
  - admin (no city)
  - vol (Mumbai) - CAN see the Mumbai post ✅
  - vol2 (Delhi) - CANNOT see the Mumbai post ❌
  - vol1 (Uttrakhand) - CANNOT see the Mumbai post ❌
  - vol3 (Punjab) - CANNOT see the Mumbai post ❌

## 🔍 Testing

To test the implementation:

1. **Login as different users:**
   ```
   vol@gmail.com (Mumbai) → Should see posts from Mumbai
   vol2@gmail.com (Delhi) → Should see posts from Delhi
   vol3@gmail.com (Punjab) → Should see posts from Punjab
   ```

2. **Create a post:**
   - Post will automatically be tagged with your city
   - Only users from your city will see it

3. **Check logs:**
   - Backend will log: User city, Query, Posts found, Total posts

## 🐛 Debugging

Run these scripts to check database state:
```bash
node check-user-city.js    # See all users and their cities
node check-posts-city.js   # See all posts and their cities
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- Users MUST have a city set in their profile to create or view posts
- City matching is case-insensitive
- Posts are automatically filtered - no way to see posts from other cities
- This creates location-based communities

## 🚀 Next Steps (Optional)

Consider adding:
1. Admin view to see all posts regardless of city
2. Option to view nearby cities (within a radius)
3. City autocomplete on registration
4. Standardized city names (to prevent "Mumbai" vs "Bombay" issues)
