# Deleted User Handling Implementation

## Problem
When a user deleted their account, their posts, comments, and group memberships remained in the database but with `null` user references. This caused frontend crashes when trying to access properties like `profilePicture` or `name` from deleted users.

## Solution
Added null-safe checks (`?.` optional chaining) throughout the frontend to gracefully handle deleted users by displaying "Deleted User" instead of crashing.

## Files Modified

### 1. **frontend/components/post-display.tsx**
- **Post Author Display** (lines ~200-220)
  - Changed `post.user.profilePicture` → `post.user?.profilePicture`
  - Changed `post.user.name` → `post.user?.name || 'Deleted User'`
  
- **Comments Section** (lines ~375-395)
  - Changed `comment.user.profilePicture` → `comment.user?.profilePicture`
  - Changed `comment.user.name` → `comment.user?.name || 'Deleted User'`

- **Edit/Delete Post Button** (line ~228)
  - Changed `user._id === post.user._id` → `post.user && user._id === post.user._id`
  - Prevents error when trying to check ownership of posts from deleted users

- **Delete Comment Button** (line ~402)
  - Changed `user._id === comment.user._id || user._id === post.user._id`
  - To: `comment.user && (user._id === comment.user._id || user._id === post.user?._id)`
  - Prevents error when checking ownership for comments from deleted users

### 2. **frontend/components/group-display.tsx**
- **Group Creator Display** (line ~171)
  - Changed `group.creator.name` → `group.creator?.name || 'Deleted User'`

### 3. **frontend/components/group-details.tsx**
- **Creator Check** (line ~375)
  - Changed `currentGroup.creator._id` → `currentGroup.creator?._id`
  
- **Group Header** (line ~423)
  - Changed `currentGroup.creator.name` → `currentGroup.creator?.name || 'Deleted User'`
  
- **Members List** (lines ~538-615)
  - Changed `member.user._id` → `member.user?._id`
  - Changed `member.user.name` → `member.user?.name || 'Deleted User'`
  - Changed member avatar initial from `member.user.name.charAt(0)` → `member.user?.name?.charAt(0).toUpperCase() || 'D'`
  - Added null check in admin buttons condition: `{isCreator && !isHost && member.user && (...)}`
  - Updated filter logic: `m.user._id` → `m.user?._id`

### 4. **frontend/components/group-chat.tsx**
- **Creator Check** (line ~152)
  - Changed `currentGroup?.creator._id` → `currentGroup?.creator?._id`
  
- **Message Sender** (lines ~249-264)
  - Changed `message.sender._id` → `message.sender?._id`
  - Changed `message.sender.name` → `message.sender?.name || 'Deleted User'`
  - Updated member lookup: `m.user._id` → `m.user?._id`

### 5. **backend/src/models/EventApplication.js**
- **Import Syntax Fix**
  - Changed `const mongoose = require("mongoose")` → `import mongoose from "mongoose"`
  - This was causing server startup failure due to CommonJS syntax in ES module project

## User Experience

### Before
- Application crashed with error: `Cannot read properties of null (reading 'profilePicture')`
- Users couldn't view posts, comments, or groups if creator/commenter was deleted

### After
- Posts from deleted users show "Deleted User" as author
- Comments from deleted users show "Deleted User" with placeholder avatar
- Groups created by deleted users show "by Deleted User"
- Group members who deleted accounts show as "Deleted User" with "D" avatar
- Messages from deleted users show "Deleted User" as sender
- Admin management buttons hidden for deleted user members
- **No crashes** - graceful degradation

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Post Display**
   - Create a test user
   - Have them create posts and comments
   - Delete the user account
   - Verify posts show "Deleted User" instead of crashing

2. **Group Features**
   - Create a group with a test user
   - Add posts/messages as that user
   - Delete the user account
   - Verify group shows "by Deleted User" and messages display correctly

3. **Edge Cases**
   - Verify admin buttons don't appear for deleted members
   - Verify creator checks work when creator is deleted
   - Check that group chat works with deleted message senders

## Technical Notes

- Used TypeScript optional chaining (`?.`) for null safety
- Fallback values: `|| 'Deleted User'` for names, `|| '/placeholder-user.jpg'` for avatars
- Key prop handling: Use `member.user?._id || 'deleted-${Math.random()}'` for unique keys
- All changes are backward compatible - existing data works fine
