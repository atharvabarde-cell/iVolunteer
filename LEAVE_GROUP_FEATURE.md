# Leave Group Feature Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented a "Leave Group" button feature that allows group members to leave groups they've joined. The button intelligently replaces the "Join" button when a user is already a member of the group.

## Changes Made

### üé® Frontend Changes

#### 1. **Group Display Component** (`/frontend/components/group-display.tsx`)

**Import Updates:**
- Added `UserMinus` icon from lucide-react for the Leave button

**New Functionality:**
- Added `handleLeave` function to handle leaving a group
- Integrated `leaveGroup` from the groups context
- Added protection to prevent group creators from leaving their own groups
- Added toast notifications for success and error states

**UI Updates:**
- Updated button layout for members:
  - Shows "View Group" button (primary action)
  - Shows "Leave" button (secondary action) for non-creator members
  - Leave button styled with red accent to indicate destructive action
- Maintained existing behavior for non-members (Join + View Details buttons)
- Group creators only see "View Group" button (cannot leave their own groups)

**Button States:**
- **Not a Member**: "View Details" + "Join" buttons
- **Regular Member**: "View Group" + "Leave" buttons
- **Group Creator**: "View Group" button only

#### 2. **Groups Context** (`/frontend/contexts/groups-context.tsx`)

**Enhanced `leaveGroup` function:**
- Now properly updates the groups list after leaving
- Sets `isMember` to false and `userRole` to null
- Updates member count
- Removes group from user groups list
- Clears current group if viewing the group being left

### üîß Backend Changes

#### **Group Controller** (`/backend/src/controllers/group.controller.js`)

**Enhanced `leaveGroup` endpoint:**
- Now returns updated group data in response
- Includes member count, isMember status, and userRole
- Provides consistent data structure for frontend state updates

**Response Structure:**
```javascript
{
    success: true,
    message: 'Successfully left the group',
    data: {
        _id: groupId,
        memberCount: updatedCount,
        isMember: false,
        userRole: null
    }
}
```

## User Experience

### Visual Feedback
- ‚úÖ Toast notification on successful leave
- ‚ùå Toast notification on error
- üé® Red-themed Leave button to indicate destructive action
- üîÑ Real-time UI updates after leaving

### Error Prevention
- Creators cannot leave their own groups (must delete instead)
- Proper authentication checks
- User-friendly error messages

### State Management
- Immediate UI updates across all group displays
- Proper cleanup of current group view
- Synchronized state between groups list and user groups

## Technical Highlights

- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript integration with proper typing
- **State Consistency**: All group lists updated simultaneously
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with user feedback
- **UX Design**: Intuitive button placement and styling
- **Permission Checks**: Proper role-based access control

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Join and Leave Flow**:
   - Join a public group
   - Verify "Leave" button appears
   - Leave the group
   - Verify "Join" button reappears

2. **Creator Protection**:
   - Create a group
   - Verify no "Leave" button appears (only "View Group")
   - Attempt to trigger leave (should show error message)

3. **State Updates**:
   - Leave a group
   - Verify member count decreases
   - Verify group removed from "My Groups"
   - Refresh page and verify state persists

4. **Multiple Groups**:
   - Join multiple groups
   - Leave one group
   - Verify other groups remain unaffected

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for this feature:
- Confirmation dialog before leaving
- Option to rejoin recently left groups
- Leave history/audit log
- Notification to group creator when member leaves
- Batch leave functionality (leave multiple groups at once)

## Implementation Notes

- Leave functionality is restricted to regular members only
- Group creators must delete the group if they want to remove it
- Member count updates in real-time after leaving
- All related state is properly cleaned up to prevent stale data
