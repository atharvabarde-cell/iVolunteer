# Event Details Page Update

## Overview
This document describes the updates made to the event details page to display the event type and reorganize the layout to show event details on top and organization details below.

## Changes Made

### Frontend Changes

#### File: `frontend/app/volunteer/[eventId]/page.tsx`

##### 1. Import Updates
Added `Video` icon for event type display:

```typescript
import {
  Calendar,
  MapPin,
  Users,
  Clock,
  CheckCircle,
  UserPlus,
  ArrowLeft,
  Award,
  Target,
  Tag,
  Image as ImageIcon,
  Building,
  Globe,
  Phone,
  Mail,
  MapPinIcon,
  Video,  // Added for event type
} from "lucide-react";
```

##### 2. Layout Reorganization

**Previous Order:**
1. Event Description
2. Organization Details
3. Event Details
4. Requirements

**New Order:**
1. Event Description
2. **Event Details** (including event type)
3. Requirements
4. **Organization Details**

This change places the most important information (what the event is about and its details) at the top, while organization information is shown below for reference.

##### 3. Event Type Display

Added a prominent event type display section at the top of the Event Details card:

```tsx
{/* Event Type */}
{event.eventType && (
  <div className="mb-6 pb-6 border-b border-gray-100">
    <div className="flex items-start space-x-3">
      {event.eventType === 'virtual' ? (
        <Video className="h-5 w-5 text-blue-600 mt-1" />
      ) : event.eventType === 'in-person' ? (
        <Building className="h-5 w-5 text-emerald-600 mt-1" />
      ) : (
        <Globe className="h-5 w-5 text-purple-600 mt-1" />
      )}
      <div>
        <p className="text-sm font-medium text-gray-900">Event Type</p>
        <div className="mt-1">
          <span className={`inline-flex items-center px-3 py-1 rounded-full text-sm font-semibold ${
            event.eventType === 'virtual' 
              ? 'bg-blue-100 text-blue-800' 
              : event.eventType === 'in-person'
              ? 'bg-emerald-100 text-emerald-800'
              : 'bg-purple-100 text-purple-800'
          }`}>
            {event.eventType === 'virtual' && <Video className="w-4 h-4 mr-1" />}
            {event.eventType === 'in-person' && <Building className="w-4 h-4 mr-1" />}
            {event.eventType === 'community' && <Globe className="w-4 h-4 mr-1" />}
            {event.eventType.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + event.eventType.slice(1).replace('-', ' ')} Event
          </span>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
)}
```

## Features

### Event Type Display
- **Visual Badge**: Color-coded badge showing the event type
  - Blue for Virtual events (💻)
  - Green for In-Person events (🏢)
  - Purple for Community events (🌍)
- **Icon Integration**: Each event type has a matching icon
- **Prominent Position**: Displayed at the top of Event Details section with a separator

### Event Type Styling
- **Virtual Events**: Blue background (`bg-blue-100`) with blue text (`text-blue-800`)
- **In-Person Events**: Green background (`bg-emerald-100`) with green text (`text-emerald-800`)
- **Community Events**: Purple background (`bg-purple-100`) with purple text (`text-purple-800`)

### Layout Benefits

#### Improved Information Hierarchy
1. **Event Description**: First thing users see - what the event is about
2. **Event Details**: Key information including:
   - Event type (new)
   - Date and time
   - Location
   - Category
   - Duration
   - Points offered
3. **Requirements**: What's needed to participate
4. **Organization Details**: Who is organizing (reference information)

#### Better User Experience
- **Top Priority Info First**: Users immediately see what the event is about and when/where it is
- **Event Type Visibility**: Clear indication of whether it's virtual, in-person, or community
- **Organization as Context**: Organization details are available but don't overshadow event information
- **Logical Flow**: Information flows from event-specific to organization-specific

### Event Type Conditional Rendering
- Only displays if `event.eventType` exists
- Handles all three event types with appropriate styling
- Capitalizes text properly (e.g., "In-Person" instead of "in-person")
- Shows matching icon for each type

## Technical Details

### Event Type Icons
```typescript
{event.eventType === 'virtual' ? (
  <Video className="h-5 w-5 text-blue-600 mt-1" />
) : event.eventType === 'in-person' ? (
  <Building className="h-5 w-5 text-emerald-600 mt-1" />
) : (
  <Globe className="h-5 w-5 text-purple-600 mt-1" />
)}
```

### Badge Styling
```typescript
className={`inline-flex items-center px-3 py-1 rounded-full text-sm font-semibold ${
  event.eventType === 'virtual' 
    ? 'bg-blue-100 text-blue-800' 
    : event.eventType === 'in-person'
    ? 'bg-emerald-100 text-emerald-800'
    : 'bg-purple-100 text-purple-800'
}`}
```

### Text Formatting
```typescript
{event.eventType.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + event.eventType.slice(1).replace('-', ' ')} Event
```
This converts:
- "virtual" → "Virtual Event"
- "in-person" → "In-Person Event"
- "community" → "Community Event"

## Component Structure

### Main Content Column (lg:col-span-2)
1. **About This Event** (Description)
2. **Event Details** (with Event Type)
   - Event Type badge
   - Date & Time
   - Location & Category
   - Duration & Points
3. **Requirements** (if applicable)
4. **Organization Details** (moved here)
   - Organization basic info
   - Contact information
   - About Us description
   - Focus areas

### Sidebar Column (lg:col-span-1)
- Participation card
- Event status
- (Unchanged)

## Benefits

1. **Clear Event Type Indication**: Users immediately know if the event is virtual, in-person, or community-based
2. **Better Information Hierarchy**: Event details come before organization details
3. **Improved Readability**: Event type stands out with color-coded badge
4. **Consistent Design**: Matches the event type badges used in the events listing page
5. **Visual Clarity**: Border separator distinguishes event type from other details
6. **Icon Consistency**: Uses same icons as the events page tabs
