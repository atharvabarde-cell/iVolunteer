# Event Creator Participation Prevention

## Overview
Implemented logic to prevent event creators from seeing participation buttons on their own events, ensuring they cannot request participation in events they created.

## Implementation Date
October 8, 2025

## Changes Made

### 1. Event Details Page (`app/volunteer/[eventId]/page.tsx`)

#### Existing Implementation:
- ✅ Already had `isEventCreator` logic in place
- ✅ Shows "You Created This Event" disabled button for event creators
- ✅ Includes explanatory message: "Event creators cannot participate in their own events"

#### Logic:
```typescript
const isEventCreator = user && event.organizationId && (
  (typeof event.organizationId === 'object' ? event.organizationId._id : event.organizationId) === user._id
);
```

### 2. Volunteer Listing Page (`app/volunteer/page.tsx`)

#### New Implementation:
- ✅ Added event creator check to button logic
- ✅ Shows "You Created This Event" disabled button for event creators
- ✅ Prioritized as the first condition in button logic hierarchy

#### Added Logic:
```typescript
// Check if current user is the event creator
const isEventCreator = user && event.organizationId && (
  (typeof event.organizationId === 'object' ? event.organizationId._id : event.organizationId) === user._id
);

if (isEventCreator) {
  return (
    <button
      disabled
      className="w-full bg-gray-100 text-gray-600 py-2 px-4 rounded-lg font-medium text-sm cursor-not-allowed flex items-center justify-center"
    >
      <Building className="h-4 w-4 mr-2" />
      You Created This Event
    </button>
  );
}
```

## Button Priority Hierarchy

### Event Details Page:
1. **Event Creator** (gray, disabled) - NEW PRIORITY
2. Already Participating (green, disabled)
3. Participation Rejected (red, clickable for reason)
4. Requested Participation (yellow, disabled)
5. Event Full (red, disabled)
6. Request Participation (blue, clickable)

### Volunteer Listing Page:
1. **Event Creator** (gray, disabled) - NEW ADDITION
2. Already Participating (green, disabled)
3. Not Eligible (gray, disabled)
4. Requested Participation (yellow, disabled)
5. Event Full (red, disabled)
6. Request Participation (blue, clickable)

## User Experience

### For Event Creators:
- **Event Details**: Clear message that they created the event and cannot participate
- **Event Listing**: Consistent "You Created This Event" button across all views
- **Visual Feedback**: Gray disabled styling with Building icon
- **Explanatory Text**: Additional context on event details page

### For Regular Users:
- **No Change**: All existing functionality remains the same
- **Consistent Experience**: Button logic works the same across both pages

## Technical Implementation

### Event Creator Detection:
- **Handles Multiple Data Formats**: Works with both string IDs and populated organization objects
- **Type Safety**: Checks data types before comparison
- **User Authentication**: Requires authenticated user to make comparison

### Data Structure Support:
```typescript
// Supports both formats:
event.organizationId = "64f5b1234567890abcdef123" // String ID
event.organizationId = { _id: "64f5b1234567890abcdef123", name: "NGO Name" } // Populated object
```

### Security Benefits:
1. **Frontend Prevention**: Stops users from seeing participation options
2. **Backend Validation**: Backend still prevents self-participation
3. **Consistent UI**: Same behavior across all event views
4. **Clear Communication**: Users understand why they can't participate

## Files Modified

1. **`app/volunteer/[eventId]/page.tsx`**
   - ✅ Already had the logic implemented
   - ✅ No changes needed

2. **`app/volunteer/page.tsx`**
   - ✅ Added event creator check
   - ✅ Added priority condition in button logic
   - ✅ Imported Building icon (already available)

## Backend Considerations

The backend already has validation to prevent event creators from participating in their own events:

```javascript
// From backend validation
if (event.organizationId.toString() === userId.toString()) {
  throw new ApiError(400, "Event creators cannot request participation in their own events");
}
```

This frontend implementation provides a better user experience by preventing the attempt entirely rather than showing an error after submission.

## Testing Scenarios

1. **Event Creator Views Own Event**: Should see "You Created This Event" button
2. **Event Creator Views Other Events**: Should see normal participation buttons
3. **Regular User Views Any Event**: Should see normal participation flow
4. **Event Data Variations**: Should work with both string and object organizationId formats
