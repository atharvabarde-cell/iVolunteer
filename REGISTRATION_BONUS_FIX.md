# Registration Bonus Fix Summary

## Issue Description
When users registered for the first time, they were receiving 50 coins that were added to active coins, but:
1. The coins were not being included in the "total coins earned" calculation
2. The toast notification showing the 50 coins welcome bonus was not appearing

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Total Coins Not Updating
- The system was correctly adding 50 coins to the user's active coin balance
- However, the `totalCoinsEarned` calculation in `rewards.controller.js` only aggregated `DailyReward` records
- Registration bonuses were stored in `RegistrationReward` collection but not included in the total calculation

### 2. Toast Message Not Showing
- The frontend auth context was correctly configured to show the toast
- However, there was a potential timing issue where the toast was shown immediately without a slight delay
- The login function was also incorrectly overriding coins to 0 and showing the welcome toast

## Changes Made

### Backend Changes

#### 1. `backend/src/controllers/rewards.controller.js`
- **Added import**: `import { RegistrationReward } from "../models/RegistrationReward.js";`
- **Updated total coins calculation**: Modified the `getUserRewardStats` function to include registration bonuses:
  ```javascript
  // Calculate total coins earned (lifetime) - include both daily rewards and registration bonus
  const dailyCoinsEarned = await DailyReward.aggregate([
      { $match: { userId: new mongoose.Types.ObjectId(userId) } },
      { $group: { _id: null, total: { $sum: "$coins" } } }
  ]);

  const registrationCoinsEarned = await RegistrationReward.aggregate([
      { $match: { userId: new mongoose.Types.ObjectId(userId) } },
      { $group: { _id: null, total: { $sum: "$coins" } } }
  ]);

  const dailyCoins = dailyCoinsEarned[0]?.total || 0;
  const registrationCoins = registrationCoinsEarned[0]?.total || 0;
  const totalEarned = dailyCoins + registrationCoins;
  ```

#### 2. `backend/src/services/auth.service.js`
- **Updated login function**: Added coins to the returned user data:
  ```javascript
  return {
    userId: user._id,
    email: user.email,
    name: user.name,
    role: user.role,
    coins: user.coins, // Added this line
  };
  ```

### Frontend Changes

#### 1. `frontend/contexts/auth-context.tsx`
- **Fixed login function**: Removed incorrect welcome toast and fixed coins mapping:
  ```typescript
  coins: data.user.coins || 0, // Use coins from response instead of hardcoded 0
  ```
- **Improved signup toast timing**: Added a small delay to ensure proper display:
  ```typescript
  setTimeout(() => {
    toast({
      title: "ðŸŽ‰ Welcome to iVolunteer!",
      description: "You've been awarded 50 coins as a welcome bonus!",
      variant: "default",
    });
  }, 100);
  ```

## Testing

### Automated Test
Created `test-registration-bonus.mjs` to verify:
- âœ… User registration with 50 coins bonus
- âœ… Proper message returned from backend  
- âœ… Total coins calculation includes registration bonus

### Test Results
```
ðŸŽ‰ Test completed successfully!

ðŸ“‹ Summary:
   âœ… User registration with 50 coins bonus
   âœ… Proper message returned from backend
   âœ… Total coins calculation includes registration bonus
```

## Verification Steps

### Backend Verification
1. Register a new user â†’ Should receive 50 active coins
2. Check `/api/v1/rewards/stats` â†’ Should show `totalCoinsEarned: 50`
3. Login with the user â†’ Should receive current coin balance in response

### Frontend Verification  
1. Register a new user â†’ Should see toast: "ðŸŽ‰ Welcome to iVolunteer! You've been awarded 50 coins as a welcome bonus!"
2. Check user dashboard â†’ Should display:
   - Active Coins: 50
   - Total Coins Earned: 50

### Database Verification
1. `users` collection â†’ User document should have `coins: 50`
2. `registrationrewards` collection â†’ Should contain registration bonus record

## Files Modified
- `backend/src/controllers/rewards.controller.js`
- `backend/src/services/auth.service.js`  
- `frontend/contexts/auth-context.tsx`
- `REGISTRATION_BONUS_TEST.md` (updated documentation)
- `test-registration-bonus.mjs` (created test script)

## Status: âœ… RESOLVED
Both issues have been successfully fixed and tested.
