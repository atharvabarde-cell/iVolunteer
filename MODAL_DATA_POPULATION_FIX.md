# Modal Data Population Fix

## Issue Description
When clicking the "Manage" button on an event in the Ngoeventtable component, the modal would open but the fields were not populated with event data. Additionally, the edit functionality needed to properly update the backend with real changes.

## Root Cause
The `fetchEvents` function was only mapping a limited subset of fields from the backend response to the frontend event objects. Fields like `description`, `time`, `duration`, `category`, `pointsOffered`, `sponsorshipRequired`, `sponsorshipAmount`, `detailedAddress`, and `eventType` were not being included in the mapped data.

Additionally, the date was being converted to a display string (`toLocaleDateString()`) immediately upon fetch, which made it incompatible with HTML5 date input fields.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Extended Event Mapping**
Updated the `fetchEvents` function to include ALL event fields from the backend:

```typescript
const mappedEvents = res.data.events.map((e) => {
  // ... existing logic ...
  
  return {
    _id: e._id,
    title: e.title,
    date: e.date, // Keep raw date for editing
    location: e.location,
    filled: participantCount,
    maxParticipants: e.maxParticipants,
    status: e.status,
    displayStatus: displayStatus,
    progress: progress,
    eventStatus: e.eventStatus,
    participants: e.participants,
    // Include all additional fields needed for the modal
    description: e.description,
    time: e.time,
    duration: e.duration,
    category: e.category,
    pointsOffered: e.pointsOffered,
    requirements: e.requirements,
    sponsorshipRequired: e.sponsorshipRequired,
    sponsorshipAmount: e.sponsorshipAmount,
    detailedAddress: e.detailedAddress,
    eventType: e.eventType
  };
});
```

**Key Changes:**
- Added 10 additional fields to the return object
- All fields from backend are now preserved in frontend state
- Data is now available for modal display and editing

### 2. **Fixed Date Handling**
Changed date storage and display to support both viewing and editing:

**Before:**
```typescript
date: new Date(e.date).toLocaleDateString(), // Converted to string immediately
```

**After:**
```typescript
date: e.date, // Keep raw date from backend
```

**Display in Table:**
```typescript
<td className="p-4 text-gray-600">{new Date(event.date).toLocaleDateString()}</td>
```

**Display in Modal:**
```typescript
{isEditMode ? (
  <input
    type="date"
    value={editedEvent?.date ? new Date(editedEvent.date).toISOString().split('T')[0] : ""}
    onChange={(e) => setEditedEvent({ ...editedEvent!, date: e.target.value })}
    className="w-full px-4 py-2 border border-gray-300 rounded-lg"
  />
) : (
  <p className="text-gray-700">{new Date(selectedEvent.date).toLocaleDateString()}</p>
)}
```

**Benefits:**
- Raw ISO date string stored in state
- Formatted for display in table and modal (read mode)
- Compatible with HTML5 date input (edit mode)
- Can be sent directly to backend API

### 3. **Backend Integration**
The existing `handleSaveEdit` function already properly sends all edited fields to the backend:

```typescript
const updateData = {
  title: editedEvent.title,
  description: editedEvent.description,
  location: editedEvent.location,
  detailedAddress: editedEvent.detailedAddress,
  date: editedEvent.date, // Now contains proper date format
  time: editedEvent.time,
  duration: editedEvent.duration,
  category: editedEvent.category,
  maxParticipants: editedEvent.maxParticipants,
  pointsOffered: editedEvent.pointsOffered,
  sponsorshipRequired: editedEvent.sponsorshipRequired,
  sponsorshipAmount: editedEvent.sponsorshipAmount,
  eventType: editedEvent.eventType,
};

await api.put(`/v1/event/${editedEvent._id}`, updateData, {
  headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${token}` },
});
```

## Files Modified

1. **frontend/components/Ngoeventtable.tsx**
   - Extended event mapping in `fetchEvents()` function (lines ~67-95)
   - Kept raw date format from backend (line ~79)
   - Updated table date display with formatting (line ~365)
   - Updated modal date display with formatting (line ~580)

## Expected Behavior

### Before Fix
1. Click "Manage" on any event
2. Modal opens with event title and basic info
3. Most fields show "N/A" or blank
4. Edit mode shows empty form fields
5. Cannot properly edit event details

### After Fix
1. Click "Manage" on any event
2. Modal opens with ALL event details populated
3. Every field shows the correct data from backend:
   - Title
   - Description
   - Category (dropdown populated)
   - Event Type (dropdown populated)
   - Location and Detailed Address
   - Date (formatted properly)
   - Time
   - Duration
   - Max Participants
   - Current Participants
   - Points Offered
   - Sponsorship details
4. Click "Edit Event"
5. All fields become editable with current values
6. Make changes to any field
7. Click "Save Changes"
8. Backend receives update request with all modified data
9. Event updates successfully
10. Toast notification: "Event updated successfully!"
11. Modal reflects new changes
12. Event list refreshes with updated data

## Backend API Compatibility

The fix maintains compatibility with the existing backend API:

**GET /v1/event/organization**
- Returns array of events with all fields
- Frontend now preserves all fields from response

**PUT /v1/event/:id**
- Accepts event update object
- Frontend sends all editable fields
- Date format compatible with backend expectations

## Edge Cases Handled

1. **Missing Optional Fields**
   - Uses nullish coalescing (`||`) for optional fields
   - Displays "N/A" or appropriate default for missing data
   - Edit mode handles undefined/null values gracefully

2. **Date Format Conversion**
   - Raw backend date preserved in state
   - Converted to `YYYY-MM-DD` for date input
   - Converted to locale string for display
   - Original format sent back to backend

3. **Number Fields**
   - `duration`, `maxParticipants`, `pointsOffered`, `sponsorshipAmount`
   - Properly converted with `Number()` on change
   - Min/max validation on inputs

4. **Boolean Fields**
   - `sponsorshipRequired` handled as true/false
   - Conditional rendering of sponsorship amount field

## Performance Impact

- **Minimal**: Added ~10 field assignments per event during mapping
- **Network**: No additional API calls
- **Memory**: Slightly larger event objects in state
- **Benefits**: Single fetch populates all data, no lazy loading needed

- PENDING_EVENTS_DISPLAY.md - Event status display feature
- Backend API documentation for event endpoints

## Future Enhancements

1. **Optimistic Updates**
   - Update UI immediately, revert on API failure
   - Improve perceived performance

2. **Field Validation**
   - Add client-side validation before save
   - Show inline error messages

3. **Change Detection**
   - Only enable "Save" button if changes detected
   - Warn user about unsaved changes on modal close

4. **Image Upload**
   - Add event image field to mapping
   - Include image upload in edit mode

## Summary

This fix ensures that when NGOs click "Manage" on any event, they see a fully populated modal with all event details. The edit functionality now properly updates all fields in the backend, making the event management system complete and functional. The date handling has been optimized to work seamlessly with both display and editing modes while maintaining compatibility with the backend API.
