# Clickable Alert Banner Feature - Interactive Pending Events Navigation

## Overview
Enhanced the pending events alert banners on both **NGO Dashboard** and **Entity Dashboard** to be **clickable and interactive**, allowing users to quickly navigate to view pending event details with a single click.

## Problem
While the alert banners informed users about pending events, users had to manually:
1. Read the alert
2. Navigate to the "Pending" tab or filter
3. Find the pending events

This created an extra step in the user flow.

## Solution
Made the alert banners **clickable** with:
- **Click to navigate**: Automatically switches to pending events view
- **Visual feedback**: Hover effects indicate interactivity
- **Clear call-to-action**: "Click to view details" text
- **Seamless UX**: One-click access from alert to event details

## Implementation

### 1. NGO Dashboard (`frontend/app/ngo-dashboard/page.tsx`)

#### Added State Management
```tsx
const [activeTab, setActiveTab] = useState("all")
```

#### Made Banner Clickable
```tsx
{pendingEvents.length > 0 && (
  <div 
    onClick={() => setActiveTab("pending")}
    className="bg-yellow-50 border border-yellow-200 rounded-lg p-4 mb-6 cursor-pointer hover:bg-yellow-100 transition-colors"
  >
    {/* ... banner content ... */}
    <p className="text-sm text-yellow-800">
      You have {pendingEvents.length} event{pendingEvents.length > 1 ? 's' : ''} waiting for admin approval. 
      {pendingEvents.length > 1 ? ' They' : ' It'} will be visible to volunteers once approved.
      <span className="font-semibold ml-1">Click to view details.</span>
    </p>
  </div>
)}
```

#### Updated Tabs Component
```tsx
// BEFORE
<Tabs defaultValue="all" className="w-full">

// AFTER
<Tabs value={activeTab} onValueChange={setActiveTab} className="w-full">
```

**Key Changes:**
- Added `activeTab` state to control which tab is active
- Changed from uncontrolled (`defaultValue`) to controlled (`value`) component
- Banner `onClick` sets `activeTab` to "pending"
- Added `cursor-pointer` and `hover:bg-yellow-100` for visual feedback
- Added "Click to view details" call-to-action text

### 2. Entity Dashboard - Ngoeventtable (`frontend/components/Ngoeventtable.tsx`)

#### Made Banner Clickable
```tsx
{pendingCount > 0 && (
  <div 
    onClick={() => setFilter("pending")}
    className="mb-6 bg-yellow-50 border border-yellow-200 rounded-lg p-4 cursor-pointer hover:bg-yellow-100 transition-colors"
  >
    {/* ... banner content ... */}
    <p className="text-sm text-yellow-800">
      You have {pendingCount} event{pendingCount > 1 ? 's' : ''} pending admin approval. 
      {pendingCount > 1 ? ' They' : ' It'} will be visible to volunteers once approved.
      <span className="font-semibold ml-1">Click to view details.</span>
    </p>
  </div>
)}
```

**Key Changes:**
- Banner `onClick` sets `filter` to "pending"
- Added `cursor-pointer` and `hover:bg-yellow-100` for visual feedback
- Added "Click to view details" call-to-action text
- Filter state already existed, just connected to banner

## Visual Design

### CSS Classes Added:
- `cursor-pointer` - Changes cursor to pointer on hover
- `hover:bg-yellow-100` - Lightens background on hover
- `transition-colors` - Smooth color transition for hover effect

### User Experience:
1. **Visual Cue**: Cursor changes to pointer when hovering
2. **Hover Effect**: Background lightens slightly to indicate interactivity
3. **Text Prompt**: "Click to view details" clearly indicates action
4. **Immediate Response**: Click instantly switches view/filter

## User Flow

### NGO Dashboard:
1. User sees yellow alert banner with pending count
2. User hovers over banner â†’ background lightens
3. User clicks banner â†’ **Automatically switches to "Pending" tab**
4. Pending events are displayed immediately

### Entity Dashboard (Ngoeventtable):
1. User sees yellow alert banner with pending count
2. User hovers over banner â†’ background lightens
3. User clicks banner â†’ **Filter automatically set to "pending"**
4. Table shows only pending events

## Benefits

### 1. **Improved User Experience**
- One-click navigation from alert to details
- Reduces user effort and cognitive load
- Intuitive interaction pattern

### 2. **Better Discoverability**
- Clear visual feedback (cursor + hover)

## Technical Details

### State Management:

**NGO Dashboard:**
- Controlled component pattern
- State: `activeTab` controls which tab is visible
- Update: `setActiveTab("pending")` on banner click

**Entity Dashboard:**
- Existing filter state reused
- State: `filter` controls which events are shown
- Update: `setFilter("pending")` on banner click

### Accessibility Considerations:
- âœ… Cursor change indicates clickability
- âœ… Hover effect provides visual feedback
- âœ… Text clearly indicates action ("Click to view details")
- ðŸ”„ Future: Add keyboard support (Enter/Space keys)
- ðŸ”„ Future: Add ARIA labels for screen readers
