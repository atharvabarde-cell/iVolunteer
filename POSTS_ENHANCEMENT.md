## Database Migration Notes

Existing posts without title and category fields will:
- Need title and category to be added manually or via migration script
- Fail validation if trying to update without these fields

Consider running a migration script to:
1. Add default titles based on description (first 50 characters)
2. Set default category to "Other" for existing posts

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Create new post with title and category
- [ ] Edit existing post (if compatible)
- [ ] Filter posts by category
- [ ] Verify post display shows title and category
- [ ] Test form validation for required fields
- [ ] Test category dropdown functionality

## Future Enhancements

1. Search posts by title
2. Category-based post statistics
3. User's favorite categories tracking
4. Category-specific post recommendations
